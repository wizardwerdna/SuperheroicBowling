### The Three Laws of TDD
1. Red: NO CODING UNTIL YOU WRITE A FAILING TEST
1. Green: CODE ONLY AS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE TEST PASS
1. Refactor: ONLY REFACTOR WHEN GREEN

### My Strategy
1. Write Integration Tests Outlining Features
1. Drive the Integration Into Unit Tests
1. Rinse and Repeat

### Building The Test Suite

1. Install node and npm from the [Node Web Site](http://www.nodejs.org)
1. Install Yeoman, Yo and the Angular Generator: `npm install -g generator-angular`
1. Install Coffeescript: `npm install -g coffee-script`

### Features We Implemented
1. Data Entry
1. Scoring Filter
1. FrameScorer Filter
1. UserErrorProtection Filter
1. Directive Component Refactoring
